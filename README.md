 Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI - Databel Telecom

Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project for Databel Telecom! In this project, we've leveraged the power of Power BI to analyze and mitigate customer churn effectively. I'd like you to explore the insights, visualizations, and strategies this repository provides to enhance customer retention in your subscription-based business.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI files using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the provided visualizations, dashboards, and conclusions.
4. Adapt the strategies and insights to your specific business context.

Key Features:
Visualized churn rates based on demographics, groups, contract types, consumption plans, account length, location, and payment methods. Created an overview dashboard, an age group dashboard, separate dashboards for payment and contract details, and extra charges, followed by insights.

Conclusions:
1. Identified the top three reasons for churn: competitor offering a better deal, superior service from a competitor, and dissatisfaction with the support person's attitude.
2. The primary churn labels associated with these reasons are "Competitor," "Dissatisfaction," and "Attitude."
3. Observed that a shorter account length in months correlates with a higher churn rate.
4. Noticed that customers using paper checks for payment tend to have a higher churn rate.
5. Discovered that opting for an unlimited data plan is linked to an increase in the churn rate.
6. The overall churn rate stands at 26.86%.
