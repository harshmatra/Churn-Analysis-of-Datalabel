Visualized churn rates based on demographics, groups, contract types, consumption plans, account length, location, and payment methods. Created an overview dashboard, an age group dashboard, and separate dashboards for payment and contract details, extra charges, followed by insights.

Conclusions:
Identified the top three reasons for churn: competitor offering a better deal, superior service from a competitor, and dissatisfaction with the support person's attitude.
The primary churn labels associated with these reasons are "Competitor," "Dissatisfaction," and "Attitude."
Observed that a shorter account length in months correlates with a higher churn rate.
Noticed that customers using paper checks for payment tend to have a higher churn rate.
Discovered that opting for an unlimited data plan is linked to an increase in the churn rate.
The overall churn rate stands at 26.86%.
